# Note: This is forked from suite/funcs_1/t/is_columns_is_cs.test with the
# addition of requiring thread_pool plugin to be loaded and only examining TP_*
# tables.
# This has the effect of testing the column metadata of all I_S tables
# introduced by thread_pool, such as TP_ADMISSION_CONTROL_ENTITIES.
#
# See the original test for details of the test's purpose.

# Result differences depending on FS case sensitivity.
